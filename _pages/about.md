About
----

I am currently a Researcher co-Investigator in the [Physics of Life](https://www.york.ac.uk/physics/research/physics-of-life/) group at the University of York (UK). This website is intended to give a quick overview of my research Vision, Methodologies, Output.

**Vision:**   
Within the field of **Soft Matter** science, I research the self-organisation of molecules into large dynamical structures. My key research activity is the development of new models and simulation techniques that act as a **double-edged sword**: while providing **new insights into complex (bio-)molecular systems** fundamental to anti-biotics and Alzheimer's disease, bio-catalysis and natural silk, they provide tools that assist the **development of novel materials** ranging from organic solar cells to silk-like polymeric fibres.

**Research Methodologies:**  
My approaches include **analytical modelling** approaches through *Statistical Mechanics* and *Master Equations* related to *Polymer Physics* and *(Supra)Molecular Self-Assembly*, model impementation through **research software engineering** (C/C++, octave, bash), and **simulation** approaches through *(kinetic)Monte Carlo* and *Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics*.

**Output:**  
My research generates  open-source [software](https://charleyschaefer.github.io/software/),  [teaching material](https://charleyschaefer.github.io/teaching/), and scientific publications. A selected number of publications is given [here](https://charleyschaefer.github.io/publications/).
For the most comprehensive list of publications I refer to my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=SKHIHrEAAAAJ&hl=nl) account.
Unpublished manuscripts (preprints) and posters are available at my [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charley_Schaefer2) account.

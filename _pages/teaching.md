Projects
-----

I offer research projects for students at BSc and MSc level with backgrounds ranging from biology and chemistry to physics.
The projects usually have a theory/modelling/computational approach and address practical questions in chemistry or biology.
The projects may be part of the curriculum or can be summer internships. 
The latter type of projects have previously been funded by the [Biological Physical Sciences Institute network](https://www.york.ac.uk/physics/bpsi/) (BPSInet York, UK), [Physics of Life](https://www.physicsoflife.org.uk/) (national, UK), and the [Erasmus Exchange Programme](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/opportunities/individuals/students/studying-abroad_en) (EU).

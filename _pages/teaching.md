Projects
-----

I offer research projects for students at BSc and MSc level with backgrounds ranging from biology and chemistry to physics.
The projects usually have a theory/modelling/computational approach and address practical questions in chemistry or biology, often within the [Physics of Life](https://www.york.ac.uk/physics/research/physics-of-life/) group at the University of York.
The projects may be part of the curriculum or can be summer internships.
The latter type of projects are typically funded by the [Biological Physical Sciences Institute network](https://www.york.ac.uk/physics/bpsi/) (BPSInet York, UK), [Physics of Life](https://www.physicsoflife.org.uk/) (national, UK), and (previously) the [Erasmus Exchange Programme](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/opportunities/individuals/students/studying-abroad_en) (EU).

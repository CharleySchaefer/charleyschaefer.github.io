The software that I develop and use for my research is (when possible) shared in public github repositories; these will be summarised on this page.
Software that is not yet publicly shared (but of which the output is used in my publications) is usually available on request.


Bombyx
---
[Bombyx](https://github.com/CharleySchaefer/Bombyx) uses a brute-force algorithm to fit the *sticky-reptation* model to the measured linear-viscoelastic response of silk feedstock, produced by the *Bombyx mori* silkworm.
The code is written in C, and its output is peer reviewed in the scientific journal [Schaefer et.,  Macromolecules 2020](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b02630). I aim to improve the algorithm further, and implement it into RepTate (see below).

MorusMD
---
MorusMD (not yet publicly available) simulates the coarse-grained molecular dynamics of sticky polymers in flow.
The simulation output is peer reviewed in the  scientific journal *Schaefer & McLeish, Phys. Rev. Lett.* (accepted) *2021*.
In my research, I use it in particular to understand the flow-induced self-assembly of silk feedstock, produced by the *Bombyx mori* silkworm.

RepTate (contribution)
---
[RepTate](https://reptate.readthedocs.io/) is a software package that enables to analyse experimental (typically rheological) data using state-of-the-art polymer-physics models.
The package was developed by the polymer-physics community of the United Kingdom.
While my contribution of implementing the [sticky reptation model](https://reptate.readthedocs.io/manual/Applications/LVE/Theory/theory.html#sticky-reptation) is modest, I find new future contributions very likely.


ZiltoidLIB
---
[ZiltoidLIB](https://github.com/CharleySchaefer/ZiltoidLIB) is called after [Ziltoid the Omniscient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziltoid_the_Omniscient) and is my personal C/C++ library that I developed as a student, and which I am still using for various applications.

Silk  produced by spiders and silkworms is tougher than steel, produced at less than a tenth of the energy consumption required for man-made fibres, and is biocompatible and biodegrable - silk is excellently suitable for medical applications and green materials.
In order to improve synthetic materials, we (myself and Prof. Tom McLeish in the [Physics of Life](https://www.york.ac.uk/physics/research/physics-of-life/) group of York) observe and learn from the animals in collaboration with Dr. Pete Laity and Dr. Chris Holland of the [Natural Materials Group](http://naturalmaterials.group.shef.ac.uk/) at the University of Sheffield.
In this publication in [Macromolecules](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b02630), we revealed that the silk protein not only looks like a polymer (which has already been known for a long time) but also *behaves* as a polymer. Specifically, we found it behaves as a *sticky polymer*. Sythethic polymers used for the manufacturing of fibres are typically *not* sticky; our work suggests that *stickiness* should become part of the strategy to design a novel class of bio-inspired fibres.  <br/>

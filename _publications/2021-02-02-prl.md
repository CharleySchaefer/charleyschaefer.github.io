Silk  produced by spiders and silkworms is tougher than steel, produced at less than a tenth of the energy consumption required for man-made fibres, 
and is biocompatible and biodegrable - silk is excellently suitable for medical applications and green materials.
In order to improve synthetic materials, we (myself and Prof. Tom McLeish in the [Physics of Life](https://www.york.ac.uk/physics/research/physics-of-life/) group of York) observe and learn from the animals in collaboration with Dr. Pete Laity 
and Dr. Chris Holland of the [Natural Materials Group](http://naturalmaterials.group.shef.ac.uk/) at the University of Sheffield.
Previously, in [Macromolecules](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.macromol.9b02630), we revealed that the silk protein not only looks like a polymer (which has already been known for a long time) but also *behaves* as a polymer. Specifically, we found it behaves as a *sticky polymer*.
Now, in  [Physical Review Letters](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.057801), we found that a broad class of sticky polymers respond very different to external stimuli (flow) than non-sticky ones do.
Our work suggests that polymeric *stickiness* should become part of the strategy to design a novel class of bio-inspired fibres.

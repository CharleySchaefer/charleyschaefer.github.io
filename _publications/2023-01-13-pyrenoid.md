Bio-polymer networks are ubiquitous in nature and fulfil unique mechanical and biological functionalities that sensitively rely on the mesoscopic structure of the network. Understanding how these structures are encoded for by the bio-macromolecular building blocks would open up a powerful means to design novel soft materials, but remains hampered by the enormous complexity of the network down to the molecular level. We focus on the CO2-fixating 'pyrenoid' in eukaryotic algae as an exemplar bi-molecular network, which is composed of rigid 'Rubisco' holoenzymes with 8 binding sites to which any of the 5 'sticker strands' of the intrinsically disordered polypeptide (IDP) 'EPYC1' may bind. As a consequence, a Rubisco-IDP complex has 10^8 structurally different microstates whose expectation values depend on the concentration, sticker binding strength, and on the force-extensiblity of the IDPs. We present a statistical physics approach to tackle this challenge, and apply it to self-consistently model available (i) surface plasmon resonance data on the competitive binding of cleaved (single-sticker) EPYC1 and (ii) fluorescence correlation spectroscopy data on the binding of full (five-sticker) EPYC1 chains. Beyond the quantitative agreement between our model and the experiments, the model pins down the regime of binding affinities and provides quantitative predictions on the structure of the rubisco-EPYC1 complex. Thus, we present a predictive model that enables the parametrisation and screening of IDP sequences towards complex networks of associating (bio-)polymers.
